  0.1.1:
    changes:
      release_summary: Updating the README.md and switching the integration tests
        to GHAs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.healthchecksio/pull/9).
    fragments:
    - 0.1.1.yaml
    release_date: '2021-10-27'
  1.1.1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - checks - support creating Simple checks. Previously, C(schedule) and C(tz)
        were defaulted which made it impossible to differentiate between Simple and
        Cron checks when creating them. Now, either C(schedule) and C(tz) must be
        provided to create a Cron check, or, C(timeout) must be provided to create
        a Simple check (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.healthchecksio/issues/16).
      bugfixes:
      - Update the tests so that they only run once (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.healthchecksio/issues/11).
      - ping - remove C(default="") on required C(uuid) parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.healthchecksio/issues/19).
      release_summary: Adding support for Simple checks.

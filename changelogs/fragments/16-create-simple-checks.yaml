breaking_changes:
  - checks - support creating Simple checks. Previously, C(schedule) and C(tz)
    were defaulted which made it impossible to differentiate between Simple and
    Cron checks when creating them. Now, either C(schedule) and C(tz) must be
    provided to create a Cron check, or, C(timeout) must be provided to create
    a Simple check (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.healthchecksio/issues/16).

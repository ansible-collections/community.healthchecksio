This Ansible collection contains modules for assisting in the automation of the [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) monitoring service. To learn more about this service, please read [https://healthchecks.io/about/](https://healthchecks.io/about/).

From their site:
> Healthchecks.io is an online service for monitoring regularly running tasks such as cron jobs. It uses the Dead man's switch technique: the monitored system must "check in" with Healthchecks.io at regular, configurable time intervals. When Healthchecks.io detects a missed check-in, it sends out alerts.

The service documentation is located at [https://healthchecks.io/docs/](https://healthchecks.io/docs/) and the API documentation is located at [https://healthchecks.io/docs/api/](https://healthchecks.io/docs/api/). This Ansible module strives for API parity.

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.healthchecksio
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:
```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.healthchecksio
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.healthchecksio --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version `0.1.0`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.healthchecksio
```
